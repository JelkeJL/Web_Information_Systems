    <h1>What are <em>Digital Humanities</em>?</h1>
    <p>The question of defining Digital Humanities has been an age old problem (not really <em>age</em> old, but you get the jist).</p>
    <p>Our attempt at defining it would be <em>the application, construction, and usage of digitial tools - of various kinds - to enhance humanities research and studies</em>. Ultimately, there might be as many definitions of the field as there are digital humanists around.</p>

    <h1>Why are we doing this?</h1>
    <p>
        Within the Programme of Digital Humanities, the optional course <em>Web Information Systems</em> is offered. The course has the following* aims: <br>
        The course proposes to provide the student with knowledge of and insight into the rapidly evolving field of web technology by means of an overview of a number of relevant topics. At the end of this course, students will:
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>be able to describe and explain the design of the basic infrastructure of the web;</li>
            <li>be able to describe and explain the design of basic components of the W3C semantic web stack; </li>
            <li>be able to evaluate and identify relevant tools for the design and implementation of a non-trivial dynamic web application; and </li>
            <li>be able to effectively use these tools in the implementation of the application.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>
        The students will be required to carry out practical and theoretical assignments for which they will have to use representatives of one or more of the technologies discussed in the lectures. <br> <br>

    </p>
    <p>
        When discussing possible projects for the course described above, we thought it would be fun and practical to make a web application that could help students who are new to the KU Leuven find their way around the city, highlighting certain <em> points of interest </em> for them. Though a similar page already existed, it was not particularly dynamic, and also terribly outdated.
